Description: 
   DuplexDiscovereR is a package designed for analyzing data from RNA 
   cross-linking and proximity ligation protocols such as SPLASH, PARIS, 
   LIGR-seq, and others.
   DuplexDiscovereR accepts input in the form of chimerically or
   split-aligned reads. It includes procedures for alignment classification,
   filtering, and efficient clustering of individual chimeric reads into duplex 
   groups (DGs). Once DGs are identified, the package predicts RNA duplex 
   formation and their hybridization energies. Additional metrics, such as
   p-values for random ligation hypothesis or mean DG alignment scores, 
   can be calculated to rank final set of RNA duplexes.
   Data from multiple experiments or replicates can be processed separately 
   and further compared to check the reproducibility of the experimental method.
