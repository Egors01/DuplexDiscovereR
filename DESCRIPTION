Description: 
    DuplexDiscoverer is a package for analysis of the data from RNA cross-linking and proximity
    ligation protocols such as SPLASH, PARIS, LIGR-seq and others.
    DuplexDiscoverer takes input in a form of Chimericly or split -aligned reads.
    It implements procedures for classification, filtering and efficient clustering 
    of inidividual read alignments into duplex groups (DGs)
    After DGs are found, RNA duplex formation and their hybridization energies 
    are predicted,additional metrics 
    i.e p-values or mean alignement scores can be calcualted to rank and analyze 
    final RNA duplex predictions.Data from multiple experiments or replicates
    can be processed separately and further compared to analyse reproducability 
    of experimental method.
